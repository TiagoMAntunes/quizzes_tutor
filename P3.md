### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests
- [Create a good question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_07-project/blob/develop/frontend/cypress/integration/studentQuestion/useStudentQuestion.js#L10)
- [Create a question without a title](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_07-project/blob/develop/frontend/cypress/integration/studentQuestion/useStudentQuestion.js#L15)
- [Create a question without a name](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_07-project/blob/develop/frontend/cypress/integration/studentQuestion/useStudentQuestion.js#L23)

- [Display questions and show a question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_07-project/blob/develop/frontend/cypress/integration/studentQuestion/useStudentQuestion.js#L37)
- [Add a topic to a question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_07-project/blob/develop/frontend/cypress/integration/studentQuestion/useStudentQuestion.js#L43)
- [Reject a student question and add an explanation](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_07-project/blob/develop/frontend/cypress/integration/studentQuestion/useStudentQuestion.js#L49)

#### Rationale
The end-to-end tests allow us to test and demonstrate all common use cases for the frontend side of the application, as well as their integration with the backend portion. In this case, we simulate a correct usage of the create a student question functionality, as well as 3 examples of incorrect usage. All incorrect usages produce an error message and do not create faulty student questions. We also simulate the usage of the accept/reject a student question functionality, as well as the abiluty to add an explanation, both working as intended.
